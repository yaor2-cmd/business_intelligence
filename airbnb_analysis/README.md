## Project Overview
This project analyzes Airbnb listing data to compare the Columbus, Ohio and New York City markets. The goal is to [briefly describe what decisions your analysis could support].

## Research Questions

1. How does the level of competition (number of nearby listings) influence the pricing of Airbnb listings in different neighborhoods?
2. In which neighborhoods is competition highest for each room type
3. Do some hosts specialize in only one room type while others diversify across types?
4. Which listings show steady price activity over time versus highly irregular activity?
5. Do hosts who manage multiple listings price their properties differently than single-listing hosts?
